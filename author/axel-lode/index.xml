      <title>Machine Learning for Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial neural networks have successfully been used to identify phase transitions from data and classify data into distinct phases in an automated fashion. The power and success of these approaches (e.g., &amp;ldquo;learning by confusion&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;prediction-based method&amp;rdquo;) can be attributed to the ability of deep neural networks to learn arbitrary functions. However, the larger a neural network, the more computational resources are needed to train it, and the more difficult it is to understand its decision making. In this project, we establish a solid theoretical foundation of popular machine-learning methods that rely on neural networks for detecting phase transitions and develop new efficient numerical routines to identify phase transitions directly from data. In the future, our methods could make it possible to detect as yet unknown phase transitions, for instance in quantum simulators or in novel materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spectral Structure and Many-Body Dynamics of Ultracold Bosons in a Double Well </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We examine the spectral structure and many-body dynamics of two and three repulsively interacting bosons trapped in a one-dimensional double-well, for variable barrier height, inter-particle interaction strength, and initial conditions. By exact diagonalization of the many-particle Hamiltonian, we specifically explore the dynamical behavior of the particles launched either at the single-particle ground state or saddle-point energy, in a time-independent potential. We complement these results by a characterization of the cross-over from diabatic to quasi-adiabatic evolution under finite-time switching of the potential barrier, via the associated time evolution of a single particle’s von Neumann entropy. This is achieved with the help of the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for indistinguishable particles (MCTDH-X)—which also allows us to extrapolate our results for increasing particle numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

In particular, unsupervised methods hold the promise to help discover new phases of matter without the need for any prior theoretical knowledge. While for phases characterized by a broken symmetry, the use of unsupervised methods has proven to be successful, topological phases without a local order parameter seem to be much harder to identify without supervision. Here, we use an unsupervised approach to identify boundaries of the topological phases. We train artificial neural nets to relate configurational data or measurement outcomes to quantities like temperature or tuning parameters in the Hamiltonian. The accuracy of these predictive models can then serve as an indicator for phase transitions. We successfully illustrate this approach on both the classical Ising gauge theory as well as on the quantum ground state of a generalized toric code.","tags":[],"title":"E. Greplova, A. Valenti, G.

By exact diagonalization of the many-particle Hamiltonian, we specifically explore the dynamical behavior of the particles launched either at the single-particle ground state or saddle-point energy, in a time-independent potential. We complement these results by a characterization of the cross-over from diabatic to quasi-adiabatic evolution under finite-time switching of the potential barrier, via the associated time evolution of a single particle’s von Neumann entropy. This is achieved with the help of the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for indistinguishable particles (MCTDH-X)—which also allows us to extrapolate our results for increasing particle numbers.","tags":["Bosonic systems","Exact Diagonalization","MCTDH-X"],"title":"F.

For up to N = 21 scatterers, we numerically optimize the positions of the individual scatterers, to maximize the total scattering cross section for an incoming plane wave, on the one hand, and to minimize the decay rate associated to a long-lived scattering resonance, on the other. In both cases, the optimum is achieved by configurations where all scatterers are placed on a line parallel to the direction of the incoming plane wave. The associated maximal scattering cross section increases quadratically with the number of scatterers for large N, whereas the minimal decay rate—which is realized by configurations that are not the same as those that maximize the scattering cross section—decreases exponentially as a function of N. Finally, we also analyze the stability of our optimized configurations with respect to small random displacements of the scatterers. These results demonstrate that optimized configurations of scatterers bear a considerable potential for applications such as quantum memories or mirrors consisting of only a few atoms.","tags":["multiple scattering","numerical optimization"],"title":"F.

It is based on training a predictive model such as a neural network to infer a physical system's parameters from its state. The deviation of the inferred parameters from the underlying correct parameters will be most susceptible and diverge maximally in the vicinity of phase boundaries. Therefore, peaks in the vector field divergence of the model's predictions are used as indication of phase transitions. Our method is applicable for phase diagrams of arbitrary parameter dimension and without prior information about the phases. Application to both the two-dimensional Ising model and the dissipative Kuramoto-Hopf model show promising results.","tags":["Machine Learning","Phase Transitions"],"title":"F. Schäfer and N.
